# coliminator-py
A very simple duplicate column value eliminator from rows

Remove duplicate columns from a row using this very simple python script:

- Run `python coliminator.py <input-file.csv> <output-file.csv>`

The input file with redundant values will be printed to the new output file. Please make sure you do not select the same output file more than once, since it will append all the values.

Delete the file if you have to use the same file name.
